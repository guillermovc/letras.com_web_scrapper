# Web Scrapper to get music lyrics from letras.com

The intention of this project is to practice the use of BeautifulSoup library and Python language for Web Scrapping. At the same time to create a tool to obtain a database of song lyrics, which can be used for all kinds of projects.

I also compare the use of Multithreading and Multiprocessing to collect considerably large amounts of data, especially when making requests to web pages.
Finally, I use all the lyrics of an artist available on the page to create a word cloud.
